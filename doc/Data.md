following series (the number corresponds to the column of data matrix):

10) Baa spreads (Moodyâ€™s)
11) Long term expected CPI, (Survey of Professional Forecasters)
12) Total factor productivity (Federal reserve Bank of San Francisco)

We use the following series to transform the data:

2) Total US Resident population (Census Bureau)

The Total Factor Productivity series is made available by the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and can be found
